// Descriptor→node resolution ladder primitives (Bug #99) — PURE math.
//
// The yarn family (classic + berry) records dependency RANGES on the consumer
// side and joins them to entries by EXACT entry-key string match. Under a
// `resolutions` (yarn) / `overrides` (npm) / `pnpm.overrides` pin, yarn rewrites
// the entry key to the PINNED descriptor and drops the consumer's own range —
// so a range consumer can no longer find its entry by exact match, the edge is
// dropped, the node orphaned, and the dependency vanishes on round-trip.
//
// These two helpers are the source-safe fallback rungs the adapters layer on
// top of the exact-match path (see the ladder doc in spec/formats/_common.md
// §"Descriptor→node resolution"). They are PURE: no Graph import, no IO, no
// Diagnostic emit. The adapter owns candidate gathering, the override source,
// and every diagnostic — these functions only do the math.
//
//   - `semverResolve` — Rung 3: SOURCE-GATED max-satisfying semver. Only an
//     `npm:`/bare descriptor may match, and only a `tarball` (registry-class)
//     candidate is eligible. A git / directory / unknown-source node is INVISIBLE
//     to an `npm:` descriptor (the #91 source-safety invariant: a git-fork node
//     must never satisfy a registry range). Final ties are NOT guessed — the
//     caller is told via `{ kind: 'ambiguous' }` and emits a `*_AMBIGUOUS_
//     RESOLUTION` warning, mirroring the existing peer-ambiguity rule.
//   - `distTagResolve` — Rung 3.5: DIST-TAG bind. A registry descriptor whose
//     range is a dist-TAG (`latest` / `next` / `node-gyp@npm:latest`) — NOT a
//     semver range — binds the SINGLE registry sibling of that name. SOURCE-gated
//     exactly like Rung 3 (tarball-only). 0 → none; 1 → bound; ≥2 → ambiguous
//     (the caller diagnoses + drops — a multi-version tag is never guessed, since
//     `latest`/`next` are channel pointers the lock cannot resolve and `next` is
//     often < `latest`).
//   - `patchPreferenceFor` — Rung-3 OVERLAY (berry only): after the registry
//     range bound its base node, prefer a sibling PATCH node of the same
//     `name@version` (the lock-borne yarn behaviour — a `patchedDependencies`
//     entry redirects every consumer of the base to the patched copy). A single
//     patch sibling redirects; ≥2 disambiguate by `::locator=` against the
//     consumer; no match keeps the base (no guess). PURE: returns the patch id or
//     `undefined`; the adapter owns the index, the boolean gates, and the
//     `*_PATCH_PREFERRED` diagnostic.
//   - `overrideTargetFor` — Rung 2: OVERRIDE-MAP forced link. Resolves the
//     human-declared pin (`OverrideConstraint`) for `(depName, declaredRange,
//     consumerPath)`. Authoritative: it precedes semver and handles a
//     NON-satisfying pin (csstype `^3.1.3` → `3.0.9`) and a non-version target
//     (`patch:` / `portal:`). Returns only the verbatim `to`; the caller feeds it
//     back through the exact-match + Rung-1 path.
